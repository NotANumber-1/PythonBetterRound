# BetterRound for Python
Improves python's incorrect rounding system

## How it works: 
 - Using default `round()` function will sometimes return you a wrong number (ex: `round(10.5)` -> 10)
 - Using `tround()` function in the module returns the right number (ex: `tround(10.5)` -> 11)
 - `tround()` function works as the same as `round()` function (except for the returning values)

## Pros: 
 - Easy install: Just drag and drop the file! No other installations are required. 
 - Easy use: Replace all `round()`s with `tround()`s, and you're done. 
 - Lightweight: Less than a kilobyte.
